This project includes multiple C programs designed to perform mathematical operations based on user input and configuration files. The project consists of various programs like "add.c," "calculator.c," "calculator1.c," "divide.c," and "multiply.c." The programs utilize pipes for inter-process communication and implement functionalities for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The "calculator.c" program orchestrates the interaction among these operations according to a specified configuration in the input file. The project allows users to perform mathematical calculations using multiple child processes, and the resulting outputs are redirected and displayed through the use of pipes. The codes showcase concepts of process management, communication, and coordination, providing a practical demonstration of creating a basic calculator with multiple operations.
